## Project Overview
This is a Kanban board application built as part of the **Agile Development and DevOps** course final project. The application demonstrates modern software development practices including REST API design, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized deployment.

## ✨ Features
- **RESTful API** for managing tasks (CRUD operations)
- **Kanban board** with multiple columns (New, In Progress, Done)
- **Sprint planning** and tracking with user stories
- **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment
- **Automated testing** with pytest (80%+ coverage)
- **Health check** endpoints for monitoring
- **Status filtering** for tasks

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Python Flask
- Database: SQLite
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker
- Testing: pytest

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python run.py`
4. Access at: `http://localhost:5000`

### Running with Docker
```bash
docker build -t kanban-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 kanban-app
```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/<id>` - Get a specific task
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create a new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/<id>` - Update a task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/<id>` - Delete a task

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1: Setup and Planning
- Set up repository structure
- Create initial Kanban board
- Define user stories

### Sprint 2: REST API Development
- Implement REST API endpoints
- Add automated testing
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Sprint 3: Deployment
- Dockerize the application
- Deploy to production
- Monitor and maintain
